# ENCIRCLE-MiniSOM
This repository utilizes the MiniSom package to implement Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for the analysis of atmospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme events. In particular, we apply SOMs to mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and 500 hPa geopotential height data.

We thank and acknowledge the tutorial of Kurtz and Martin (2023) (https://github.com/taliakurtz/MiniSOM_tutorial) on the Python package MiniSom as a starting point for our coding.
